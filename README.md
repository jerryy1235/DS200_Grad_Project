## Objectives
We suspect greenhouse gas levels have an impact on weather and air quality, and we know that there're various emitter facilities throughout the country. Can we predict weather and air quality at a certain location given greenhouse gas emitters' information in that area?

## Environment Setup
We use Anaconda as our package manager. 

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2. Open an Anaconda terminal, run as administrator
3. Install required packages:  `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab seaborn`  `conda install -c anaconda pandas scikit-learn`
4. Clone this repository to your computer
5. In the Anaconda terminal, navigate to your repo directory
6. Open an instance of Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
7. Continue in your browser

**UC Berkeley EECS**

## Objectives
We suspect greenhouse gas levels have an impact on weather and air quality, and we know that there're various emitter facilities throughout the country. Can we predict weather and air quality at a certain location given greenhouse gas emitters' information in that area?

## Environment Setup
We use Anaconda as our package manager. 

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2. Clone this repository to your computer
3. Open an Anaconda terminal, run as administrator
4. In the Anaconda terminal, navigate to your repo directory
5. Install required packages from env file:  `conda env create -f conda_environment.yml`
6. Activate working environment: `conda activate 200_grad_proj`. You need to activate this environment each time you start an Anaconda terminal. Refer to [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28436769/how-to-change-default-anaconda-python-environment) to make it default.
7. Start an instance of Jupyter Lab using command: `jupyter lab`
8. Continue in your browser

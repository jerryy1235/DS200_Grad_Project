**UC Berkeley EECS**

## Objectives
We suspect greenhouse gas levels have an impact on weather and air quality, and we know that there're various emitter facilities throughout the country. Can we predict weather and air quality at a certain location given greenhouse gas emitters' information in that area?

## Environment Configuration
We use Anaconda as our package manager. Use the following command to install required packages:

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab seaborn -c anaconda pandas scikit-learn seaborn`
